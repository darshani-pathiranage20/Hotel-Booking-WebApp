# 1.// express > to create the back end server
# 2.// dotenv > to manage environment variables
# 3.// cors > to handle cross-origin requests > enable communication between front end and back end (allow backend to connect with anyother frontend URL)
# 4.// mongoose > to interact with MongoDB database
# 5.// nodemon > to automatically restart the server during development when file changes are detected
# // cloudinary > to manage and manipulate media assets (like images and videos) in the cloud
# // multer > to handle file uploads from clients
# // svix > make API calles - helps with the HTTP request (to send webhooks and manage webhook endpoints)

# // jsonwebtoken > to handle user authentication and authorization using JWTs
# // bcryptjs > to hash and verify passwords for secure user authentication
# // cookie-parser > to parse cookies from incoming requests
# // body-parser > to parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the req.body property



# - `/` = root path (like homepage)
# - When someone visits `http://localhost:4000/`, this runs

# - `req` = **request** object (data coming IN)
# - `res` = **response** object (data going OUT)

# - `app.listen()` = Turn on the server
# - `PORT` = Which port to listen on
# - `() => { ... }` = Callback function that runs ONCE when server starts
# - `console.log()` = Confirmation message

# ----- listen() --------
# **Event loop** - the server starts and **continuously waits** for requests (doesn't stop).


# Server starts on port 4000
#       ↓
#   [LISTENING...] ← Infinite loop waiting
#       ↓
# Request comes in → Process it → Send response
#       ↓
#   [LISTENING...] ← Back to waiting
#       ↓
# Another request...
# ```

# **Real analogy:**  
# Restaurant **opens its doors** and waits for customers. It stays open (listening) until you close it (stop the server).


<!-- folder structure 

1. configs - add all configuration files that will help us to connect with other services like mongoDB and cludinary, ect.....
2. controllers - add all the controllers fils and using that create the APIs
3. middleware - store the middleware that are use before executing the controller files on the API call
4. models - store the models that are use to store the data in the mongoDB database
5. routes - declear all the routes for the API -->


# deploy process

create file --> vercel.json --> Vercel json config for express backend
